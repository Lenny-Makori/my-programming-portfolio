    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>I have gone through the primary school level and also finished high school level. I also joined university back in 2014, and did Computer Science with Mathematics, But I unfortunately dropped out since i felt that the university course was ideally irrelevant. After that I became a casual worker for a while until when i heard of Moringa School from a friend. and I decided that this was a perfect chance to go back to pursuing my dreams.For anyone who has passion in becoming a software developer, I would  highly recommend <span class="preference">Moringa School</span></p>
    <p>Anyway, despite my passion in being a developer, i have several hobbies and interests. Some of them include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Playing games</strong> I love gaming alot! and i do it mostly during my free time.</li>
      <li><strong>Music</strong> I love music alot, and i have pursued my music career abit. I have a few tracks myself. Get to know me more to find out!</li>
      <li><strong>Travelling</strong> I also love travelling and exploring new places.</li>
    </ul>
